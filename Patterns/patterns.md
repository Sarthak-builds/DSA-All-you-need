Almost all the patterns will have inner and outer Nested loops.
Outer Loop: mainly for the rows
Inner Loop: for the columns
For the outer loop, count the number of lines and for the inner loop, focus on the columns and connect them somehow to the rows.
Print the "*" inside the inner for loop
Observe the symmetry.
